# CSC207H1---W2016
Software Design class I took, Winter 2016

Although I really liked programming in Java, I think this offering of 207 wasn not really great. 4 Assignments, we were told how many people to work with in each one of them.

Solo on A0 and A3, with another student on A1 (Amogh Viswanath) and in a team of 4 for A2 (Kasra Foroughi, Amogh Viswanath, Kevin Schubert and I).
