//Sprint 4 Backlog.  
March 13 to March 20


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
                                                   
a) As a user I would like to give full paths.       
b) As a user I would like to give a path that navigates to my 
   current directory, from my current directory.
   
c) As a user I would like my paths to not start with MASTER/  
   and instead start with /.    
               
d) As a user I would like to move a directory into another.
 
e) As a user I would like to give invalid and valid files to  
   the CAT command, have it show the valid file contents, and 
   tell me which files do not exist.     
                                                 
f) As a user I would like to get a file from a URL and store  
   it in my current working directory.      
                         
g) As a user I would like to re-execute previous commands.    
                                    

Specific tasks to be accomplished:

a-1. Modify Commands' navigatePath method to first move to the MASTER dir then
     navigate the path.
b-1. In the navigatePath method, set a condition that sets the manipulatedDir
     to itself if a . is given.
c-1. Modify MASTER dir's name, and all references to its name.
c-2. Set a condition so that no dir can be made with an empty string.
d-1. Create a MV class that is a subclass of Commands that has an execute
     method that simply removes the target from its parent directory, and stores
     it in the given directory.
e-1. In the CAT class move the catch block into the printFileContents command, 
     and instead of printing a generic error, print out which parameters are 
     invalid.
f-1. Create a GET class that is a subclass of Commands that has an execute 
     method that gets the contents of the given URL, and creates a file with
     the name of the URL's file, and stores the contents in the file.
g-1. Create a NUMBER class that is a subclass of Commands that has an execute
     method that simply executes a command from the history corresponding to the
     given number. 
g-2. In JShell, if the first object of commands starts with an ! mark and has a
     number following it, replace the "!#" with "NUMBER", and append the string
     "#" to the commands.
