What did I do last time?
   - Finalize the project
   - Edit any comments
   - Reconstruct if needed
    
What do I plan to do now?
   - Modify Commands' navigatePath method to first move to the MASTER dir then
     navigate the path.
   - Modify MASTER dir's name, and all references to its name.
   - Set a condition so that no dir can be made with an empty string.
   - In the CAT class move the catch block into the printFileContents command, 
     and instead of printing a generic error, print out which parameters are 
     invalid.

   
Am I blocked on anything?
    - No
